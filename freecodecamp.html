        <p>“He never looks for praises. He’s never one to boast. He just goes on quietly working. For those he loves the most. His dreams are seldom spoken. His wants are very few and most of the time his worries will go unspoken too
hes there. A firm foundation through the storms of life. A sturdy hand to hold too. In times of stress and strife. A true friend we can turn to. When times are good or bad. One of our greatest blessings, The man that we call Dad. ”</p>
